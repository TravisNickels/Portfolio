  "tagline": "Centralized project tracking and workflow management for multiple hospitals",
  "description": "A custom internal platform to track IT projects across six hospitals, replacing restrictive SharePoint workflows. It provided dashboards, automated alerts, and forms to manage overlapping projects, downtime notifications, and procurement processes.",
  "overview": "The system allowed me to organize, monitor, and report on nearly 50 IT projects annually. It combined project tracking, change requests, procurement, and downtime reporting into a single platform, streamlining weekly meetings and executive reporting.",
  "architectureSummary": "Built on ASP.NET Core 3.1 with Entity Framework for SQL Server, the platform included a web front-end with real-time updates via JavaScript, hosted on an on-premises server accessible by all facilities. Notifications were sent via Microsoft Exchange SMTP.",
  "technicalApproach": [
    "Forms and dashboards for project staff input and weekly executive monitoring",
    "Automated alerts for project risk, planned and unplanned downtime",
    "Generic code structure using interfaces and abstractions to handle changing business requirements",
    "Integration with Microsoft Exchange for email notifications"
  ],
  "outcome": "Improved visibility and control over overlapping projects, streamlined weekly project meetings from an hour to 25-30 minutes, and reduced manual paper-based processes by moving approvals and workflows online.",
