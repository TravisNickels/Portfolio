## Research & Experimental Projects

### Messaging Bridge (Alpha release)

**Stack:** C#, MSMQ, ASB, ASQ  
**Challenge:** Teams needed to connect systems running on different transports (MSMQ, ASB, ASQ ), but no bridging capability existed in NServiceBus.  
**Result:** Contributed to the alpha release of a bridging component that enabled early adopters to interoperate across messaging systems, shaping the foundation for future designs.

**Key Contributions:**

- Collaborated with the team to prototype and validate cross-transport messaging features.
- Focused on validating feasibility of early design patterns for message routing and reliability.
- Authored and reviewed documentation and samples for early adopters.
- Contributed to discussions that shaped the long-term approach for bridging different messaging systems.

**Artifacts:**

- [NServicebus Messaging Bridge 0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus.MessagingBridge/releases/tag/0.1.0-alpha.1) - (Pre-release)
- [NServicebus Messaging Bridge 0.1.0](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus.MessagingBridge/releases/tag/0.1.0) - (Release)
- [Particular Docs on Messaging Bridge](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/bridge/) - (Documentation)

### JustSaying

**Stack:** C#, .NET Core, AWS SQS/SNS (JustSaying)  
**Challenge:** Needed to evaluate whether open-source frameworks like JustSaying could extend or complement NServiceBus by improving reliability and extensibility in distributed messaging.  
**Result:** Validated architectural patterns (envelope wrapping, middleware pipelines) that informed later production designs and expanded understanding of message context handling.

**Key Contributions:**

- Experimented with **envelope wrapping** approaches to standardize message metadata (headers, correlation IDs, versioning).
- Prototyped **middleware pipelines** to test extensibility for injecting logging, retries, and metrics.
- Explored **message flow validation** to understand effects on traceability, observability, and interoperability.
- Shared findings that influenced broader architectural discussions on distributed messaging reliability.

**Skills demonstrated:** Distributed systems research, prototyping, architecture validation, critical evaluation of open-source frameworks.
